## Abstract
I replicate Enos' "What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior" using the author's replication data from the Harvard Dataverse (@Enos_rep_data). @Enos2015's figures replicate, but his table cannot be recreated since the necessary dataset is not included in the Dataverse.

# I keep them as they are.

# These are setting limits on the axes and setting other values
# for the x and y axes.

Note: Difference-in-differences results for treatment groups defined by increasing distance from the demolished projects. Differences are for the mean turnout in 2004 minus the mean turnout in 2000 for the treatment group minus the same difference for the control group. White circles represent the mean effect on white voters; black circles represent the mean effect on black voters. The N in each treatment group is in parentheses next to the mean effect. Vertical lines represent the 95% confidence intervals generated by bootstrapped standard errors of the difference between treatment and control.

Note on both figures: Coefficients on treatment as defined by increasing distance from the demolished projects from OLS regressions on change in turnout from 2000 to 2004 (triangles). N for the regression using matched groups is next to the point representing the coefficient. The treatment group in Figure 2 treatment group is matched to a control group of white voters living near projects that were not demolished, using nearest neighbor matching. The treatment group in Figure 3 is matched to a black control group of the same N using the same matching system, including variables on homeownership and home value. Regressions include variables used in matching as controls. Vertical lines represent the 95% confidence intervals generated by bootstrapped standard errors on the treatment coefficient.

Note: Predicted effects generated from $vote2004 = 􏰀0 + 􏰀1(log(distance)) + 􏰀2(log(localpercent)) + vote2000$, with white voters. Figure 4(a) is the predicted probability that a person who voted in 2000 will vote in 2004 with increasing distance, while holding size at its mean. Figure 4(b) is the predicted probability that a person who voted in 2000 will vote in 2004, with increasing outgroup population size, with distance = 100. Dotted lines represent 95% confidence intervals generated by bootstrapped standard errors.
