# Gov-1006-Replication-4

This is Jack Schroeder's replication of ["What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior"](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/enoschicago.pdf) by Ryan D. Enos (2015) using data from the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26612). It is the fourth replication assignment for Gov 1006: Models.

Please run with `unzip.R` before moving onto `Week-1.Rmd`.

The repo contains the following:
* `enos_files.zip`, which must be uncompressed before running any code
* An R script, `unzip.R`, which unzips `enos_files.zip`
* A `.gitignore` file  
* `Week-1.Rmd`, which contains the replication work (of both weeks!)
* `Week-1.html`, which contains the replication output
* `bibliography.bib`, which holds references  
* and `README.md`, which you are finished reading
